				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.adho.org/">ADHO</a> and <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a> invite all members of ADHO constituent organizations to attend a joint Annual General Meeting (AGM) as part of the <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/">Digital Humanities 2013 </a>conference. The AGM will take place on Friday, July 19th from 12:00 &#8211; 1:30pm, with a focus on two new international DH initiatives, GO::DH and DH Commons. It will end with a “SIG Slam,” where those interested in starting an ADHO Special Interest Group will be able to give one-minute pitches and then meet in small groups with others interested in working with them.</p>
<p>After a few business announcements, the session will begin with a presentation by Ryan Cordell and Isabel Galina, who along with Laurent Romary are the Co-Editors-in-Chief of centerNet’s new publication, <em>DHCommons</em>, an overlay journal for peer reviewing digital humanities projects that will launch in the coming year. Following Ryan and Isabel will be Dan O’Donnell and Alex Gil, who will be presenting on <a href="http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/">Global Outlook:: Digital Humanities</a>, ADHO’s first sponsored special interest group. The final 20 minutes of the AGM will feature ADHO’s first “SIG Slam.” Some potential SIGs already suggested include: DH and Libraries, DH and Linked Open Data, DH and Bioinformatics, DH and Postcolonialism, DH and Small Liberal Arts Colleges, DH and Social Justice, DH and Born Digital Preservation, and DH and Disability.</p>
<p>There will be 50 box lunches available on a first come, first serve basis.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DH pedagogy is of keen interest to many, but we seldom have opportunities to share our best ideas about it, especially in person. To help address this sad situation, the <a href="http://ach.org">ACH</a> will host a round of Pedagogy Lightning Talks during its annual general meeting at the DH2013 Conference in Nebraska.</p>
<p>We think we&#8217;ll all be energized by a fast-moving series of very brief, informal talks devoted to a single exercise, classroom gambit, reading, assignment or project that — or a failure that is equally instructive.</p>
<p><strong>One Slide, One Minute:</strong> talks will be one minute long, and we will allow one slide.</p>
<p>The slide can be simple&#8211;just your name, a short talk title or the name of your strategy, and contact information. Or you could include a screenshot that shows a site or tool or summarizes a strategy.</p>
<p>No live web demos, due to time constraints, but you can use your slide to point to a screenshot or URL: we&#8217;ll be posting the slides online for reference and for those who can&#8217;t get to Nebraska.</p>
<p>If you would like to present, please email your slide (in PowerPoint or Pages format) to secretary at ach-dot-org by July 12th.  We will combine all the slides into one document and post them online, as well as project them at the AGM itself.</p>
<p>Please consider sharing a great teaching strategy with us in Lincoln! The ACH AGM will be held on Wednesday at lunchtime in the Nebraska Student Union. (Lunch will be served!) And <a href="http://ach.org/activities-dh2013">check here</a> for a listing of all of our fun ACH activities at this year&#8217;s conference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matthew Jockers has posted information about the unofficial DH fun run, to be held July 18, 2013 in Lincoln. He has asked participants to arrive at the north side of the UNL Student Union (fountain area) where the route begins at 6 a.m. for a 6:15 departure. The 4.75-mile (7.65-kilometer) route is expected to take 45 minutes, allowing participants to be back on campus at 7 a.m., with enough time to attend conference sessions at 8:30.</p>
<p>Jockers notes, &#8220;Morning temperatures in July are likely to be in mid 70s (that’s ~24 degrees centigrade) and it will be humid. A water bottle is recommended (and you’ll find one in your conference swag bag!).&#8221; His website includes a map of the entire route. For more information, <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/2013/06/23/dh-fun-run-2013/">click here</a>.</p>
