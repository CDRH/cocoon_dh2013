				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matthew Jockers has posted information about the unofficial DH fun run, to be held July 18, 2013 in Lincoln. He has asked participants to arrive at the north side of the UNL Student Union (fountain area) where the route begins at 6 a.m. for a 6:15 departure. The 4.75-mile (7.65-kilometer) route is expected to take 45 minutes, allowing participants to be back on campus at 7 a.m., with enough time to attend conference sessions at 8:30.</p>
<p>Jockers notes, &#8220;Morning temperatures in July are likely to be in mid 70s (that’s ~24 degrees centigrade) and it will be humid. A water bottle is recommended (and you’ll find one in your conference swag bag!).&#8221; His website includes a map of the entire route. For more information, <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/2013/06/23/dh-fun-run-2013/">click here</a>.</p>

<p>In 2013 the <a href="http://sheldonartmuseum.org">Sheldon Museum of Art</a> celebrates the 50th anniversary of its Philip Johnson building and the 125th anniversary of the Sheldon Art Association, which is the museum&#8217;s support group.</p>
<p>In commemoration of these anniversaries, exhibitions this year will highlight the strength of the Sheldon&#8217;s permanent collections. In July, two featured collections will be ongoing.</p>
<h2 id="page_title"><strong>50 Gifts for 50 Years</strong></h2>
<p>late June 2013 <i>- </i>September 22, 2013</p>
<p>(Details to come)</p>
<h2 id="page_title">&#8220;Look for Beauty&#8221;: Philip Johnson and Art Museum Design</h2>
<p>July 11, 2013 <i>-</i> mid October 2013</p>
<p>This exhibit examines three Johnson-designed museum buildings: Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute, 1960; the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth, Texas, 1961; and the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery (now the Sheldon Museum of Art), University of Nebraska, Lincoln, 1963. While Johnson (1906-2005) designed several museums and galleries during his long career, these three early projects form a coherent trio to study the arc of Johnson’s developing personal aesthetic that wed International Style modernism to historical architectural references.</p>

<p>Housed within Morrill Hall, the <a title="University of Nebraska State Museum" href="http://museum.unl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska State Museum</a> was founded in 1871. The museum includes <a title="Mueller Planetarium" href="http://www.spacelaser.com/" target="_blank">Mueller Planetarium</a>, which features a 360-degree Fulldome Experience, as well as a wide range of <a title="University of Nebraska State Museum Exhibits" href="http://museum.unl.edu/exhibits/index.html" target="_blank">exhibits</a> that explore the natural and cultural history of Nebraska. On display in Morrill Hall is the world&#8217;s largest exhibited elephant skeleton: a 14-foot male mammoth from the Late Pleistocene Era. The giant mammoth was found in 1922, in Lincoln County, Nebraska, by a rancher and his wife. They turned the fossil over to the Museum for exhibit and research.</p>
